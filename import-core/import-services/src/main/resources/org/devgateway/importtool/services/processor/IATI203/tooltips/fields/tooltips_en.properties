default-flow-type=\n        Whether the activity is funded by Official Development\n        Assistance (ODA), Other Official Flows (OOF), etc\n
transaction=\n        Transactions recording committed or actual funds flowing in or\n        out of an aid activity.\n
sector=\n        A recognised code, from a recognised vocabulary, classifying\n        the purpose of the activity. Sector MUST EITHER be reported\n        here OR at transaction level for ALL transactions\n
recipient-country=\n        A country that will benefit from this activity. If a specific\n        country is not known the recipient-region element should be\n        used instead. For geographical location, use the location\n        element.\n\n        Multiple countries and regions can be reported, in which case\n        the percentage attribute MUST be used to specify the share of\n        total commitments across all reported countries and regions.\n\n        The country can also be specified at transaction rather than\n        activity level. If recipient-country OR recipient-region are \n        reported at the transaction level, ALL transactions MUST \n        contain a recipient-country or recipient-region element and \n        iati-activity/recipient-country \n        and iati-activity/recipient-region MUST NOT be used.\n
iati-identifier=\n        A globally unique identifier for the activity.\n\n        This MUST be prefixed with EITHER the current IATI\n        organisation identifier for the reporting organisation\n        (reporting-org/\\@ref) OR a previous identifier reported in\n        other-identifier, and suffixed with the organisation\u2019s own\n        activity identifier. The prefix and the suffix should be\n        separated by a hyphen "-".\n\n        Once an activity has been reported to IATI its identifier MUST\n        NOT be changed in subsequent updates.\n
participating-org=\n        An organisation involved with the activity. May be a donor,\n        fund, agency, etc. Specifying the @ref identifier is strongly\n        recommended. May contain the organisation name as narrative.\n\n        If the reporting organisation plays a role in the activity it\n        should be repeated here. One organisation may play more than\n        one role (eg, funding and implementing)\: in such a case each\n        role should be reported and the name of the organisation\n        repeated.\n
activity-scope=\n        The geographical scope of the activity\: regional, national,\n        sub-national, etc.\n
policy-marker=\n        A policy or theme addressed by the activity. This element was\n        designed for the reporting of OECD DAC CRS policy markers\n        (columns 20-23 and 28-31 of the CRS++ reporting format) but\n        the vocabulary attribute allows it use by other (including\n        local) systems. This element can be repeated for each policy\n        marker. \n
default-finance-type=\n        The type of finance (e.g. grant, loan, debt relief, etc). This\n        the default value for all transactions in the activity report;\n        it can be overridden by individual transactions.\n
location=\n        The sub-national geographical identification of the target\n        locations of an activity. These can be described by gazetteer\n        reference, coordinates, administrative areas or a textual\n        description. Any number of locations may be reported.\n
default-aid-type=\n        The type of aid being supplied (project-type intervention,\n        budget support, debt relief, etc.). This element specifies a\n        default for all the activity's financial transactions; it can\n        be overridden at the individual transaction level.\n
activity-status=\n        The current status of the activity. See codelist for values.\n
activity-date=\n        The planned and actual start and completion dates of the\n        activity. Start dates may reflect either the commencement of\n        funding, planning or physical activity. End dates should,\n        wherever possible, reflect the ending of physical activity.\n        \n        The narrative content may contain text (e.g. 2011Q1) for\n        accurately recording less specific dates such as month,\n        quarter, or year.\n
default-tied-status=\n        Whether the aid is untied, tied, or partially tied. This\n        element specifies a default for all the activity's financial\n        transactions; it can be overridden at the individual\n        transaction level.\n        \n        If an activity is partially tied it is recommended that tied\n        and untied commitments are reported as separate transactions\n        and that transaction/tied-status is used to classify them.\n
provider-org=For incoming funds this is the organisation from which the transaction originated. If omitted on \
  outgoing funds the reporting-org is assumed.
activity-scope=The geographical scope of the activity: regional, national, sub-national, etc.
description=\n A longer, human-readable description containing a meaningful description of the activity.\n May be repeated for different languages.\n
