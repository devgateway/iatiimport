            This is a list of organisation identifiers that is maintained by the IATI Secretariat.
            The prefix for organisations on this list is XI-IATI 
            Any publisher may apply to the IATI Technical Team for an identifier to be generated.
            While some of these identifiers have been derived from DAC codes, this 'meaning' is not carried forward. i.e. IATI generated identifiers have no intrinsic meaning.
