                <narrative>N.B. Within this category, members able to do so are requested to report the aggregate amount used for financing donor experts/consultants on Table DAC11. Where the activity consists solely of expertsâ€™ costs, report under category D. A project is a set of inputs, activities and outputs, agreed with the partner country*, to reach specific objectives/outcomes within a defined time frame, with a defined budget and a defined geographical area. Projects can vary significantly in terms of objectives, complexity, amounts involved and duration. There are smaller projects that might involve modest financial resources and last only a few months, whereas large projects might involve more significant amounts, entail successive phases and last for many years. A large project with a number of different components is sometimes referred to as a programme, but should nevertheless be recorded here.</narrative>
